    probably do not need this.  anyway it looks ok.

    one option would be to load a model based on a message.  but we can already do that.
    unless its a che message i guess. fuck it.

    leave it be for timebeing.  probably will have value on mobile client (note mobile client CAN NOT USE java8 code in models,.so likely no).
