/*
 testing notes
*/

as i will be doing tango 2016 early

notes for dev / testing

1: need to upgrade testing framwork (all of it)
2: there is an issue when we restart che.  ie not reconnecting, needs tests for this
3: where i am at. basically, need to create socket (client) and nexus
4: need to test message parsing and throughput at high levels
5: deployment, including my own testing.....

basically, need test framework and fix tests.  otherwise its all good.


(we may actually need to consider consolidating it all on 1 server, not two).

For time being its not a major issue it still supports 65,000 channels (possibly more if i look at low level code).


go to gym is a bit extreme this evening?  though i could do with getting out for a bit in reality.
